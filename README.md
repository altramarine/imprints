# imprints
simd enabled column imprints for testing

## How to compile

Source files under `src/`. Header files under `include/`.

```
make
```

Executable file is `imprints`. Check also `run-all.sh` for examples on how to invoke imprints.

## ToDo list

* fix a small bug on imprints queries, when the query is at the 0 bit.
* (done-ish) split and name the files a bit better
* maybe try to do simd WAH
