\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

Column imprints is a light-weight secondary index with a small memory
footprint suited for a main-memory setting. It belongs to the class of
bitvector indexes, which has a proven track record of improving access in
large-scale data warehouses. Our extensive experimental evaluation
shows significant query evaluation speed-up against pure scans and the
established indexing approaches of zonemaps and bitmaps with bit-binning and
WAH compression. The storage overhead of column imprints is just a few percent,
with a max of 12\% over the base column.

Column imprints can be extended to exploit multi-core
platforms during the construction phase and during multi-attribute query
processing. Akin to prevailing techniques, such as~\cite{SW07,WMC10}, judicious
choice of the binning scheme, and a multi-level imprints organization, may
lead to further improvements in specific application domains.
